# Story 3.3: 可视化物料清单与状态

## Status

Ready for DONE

## Story

**As a** warehouse operator (仓库操作员),
**I want** to visualize material lists with clear status indicators and interact with material statuses,
**so that** I can efficiently track and update material verification progress during the picking verification workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Display comprehensive order details from Story 3.2 with enhanced material status visualization using prominent "color + icon" combinations
2. Organize materials into three collapsible sections: "断线物料" (Line Break Materials), "中央仓物料" (Central Warehouse Materials), "自动化库物料" (Automated Warehouse Materials)
3. For each material category section, display completion status summary (e.g., "3/5 完成") in section headers
4. Implement five distinct material status states with clear visual differentiation:
   - 待处理 (Pending) - Gray color with pending icon
   - 处理中 (In Progress) - Yellow/Orange color with progress icon
   - 已完成 (Completed) - Green color with checkmark icon
   - 异常 (Error) - Red color with error icon
   - 缺失 (Missing) - Dark red color with missing icon
5. Each material item displays: name, required quantity vs available quantity, current status, and location information
6. Enable tap-to-update status functionality for individual material items with immediate visual feedback
7. Provide status change confirmation dialog with Chinese localization for critical status updates
8. Update category section headers automatically when individual material statuses change
9. Maintain proper industrial PDA design standards with high contrast, large fonts, and large touch targets
10. Support both portrait and landscape orientations for optimal PDA usage
11. Implement smooth section expand/collapse animations for better user experience
12. Show clear visual progress indicators for overall order completion percentage
13. Persist material status changes locally until final submission in Story 3.4

```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

**BLoC Pattern Extension for Status Management:**

- Extend existing PickingVerificationBloc with new states: MaterialStatusUpdated, CategorySectionToggled, StatusUpdateError
- Add new events: UpdateMaterialStatus, ToggleCategorySection, ResetMaterialStatus, PersistStatusChanges
- Maintain existing event-driven flow: UI Event → BLoC Processing → State Update → UI Rebuild
- Status changes should be immediately reflected in UI with local persistence until Story 3.4 submission
- Category completion calculations should update automatically when individual material statuses change

### Material Status Visualization Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR7]

**Five Material Status States with Color + Icon Requirements:**

1. **待处理 (Pending)**: Gray color with pending/clock icon - initial state for unprocessed materials
2. **处理中 (In Progress)**: Yellow/Orange color with progress/spinner icon - materials currently being processed
3. **已完成 (Completed)**: Green color with checkmark icon - materials fully verified and ready
4. **异常 (Error)**: Red color with error/warning icon - materials with issues requiring attention
5. **缺失 (Missing)**: Dark red color with missing/cross icon - materials not found or unavailable

**Category Organization:**

- **"断线物料" (Line Break Materials)**: Materials from production line interruptions
- **"中央仓物料" (Central Warehouse Materials)**: Materials from central warehouse inventory
- **"自动化库物料" (Automated Warehouse Materials)**: Materials from automated storage systems

### UX Design Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md + wireframes]

**Industrial PDA Design Standards:**

- **清晰第一**: Material statuses must be extremely clear and unambiguous with prominent visual indicators
- **即时反馈**: Every status change tap must provide immediate, perceivable visual feedback
- **工业级耐用性**: High contrast colors, large fonts (minimum 16sp), large touch targets (minimum 44dp)
- **Large Touch Targets**: All interactive elements optimized for gloved operation
- **High Contrast**: Status colors must be distinguishable in various lighting conditions

**Status Interaction Design:**

- Primary interaction: Tap material item → Status selection dialog → Confirmation → Immediate visual update
- Secondary interaction: Category sections expand/collapse with smooth animations
- Visual feedback: Status changes reflected immediately in both individual items and category summaries

### Wireframe Integration

|   [⏳] 物料E - 8个  - 拣配中                      |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### Local Storage Requirements

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md + Story requirements]

**Status Persistence Strategy:**

- Use flutter_secure_storage for sensitive material status data
- Implement local caching of status changes until final submission in Story 3.4
- Status changes must persist across app restarts and network interruptions
- Provide offline capability for status updates with sync when network available

### Responsive Design Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux requirements + NFR2]

**Multi-Orientation Support:**

- Portrait mode: Optimized for single-hand operation with vertical material lists
- Landscape mode: Enhanced visibility with wider category sections and side-by-side layout
- Maintain touch target sizes and readability across both orientations
- Ensure smooth transitions when device orientation changes

### Integration with Story 3.4

[Source: Epic 3 workflow and Story dependencies]

**Data Structure Preparation:**

- Material status changes must be structured for API submission in Story 3.4
- Prepare validation logic for "all materials completed" requirement (FR8)
- Status change history should be maintained for audit trail
- Final verification button enablement logic should be prepared but not implemented

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md + NFR requirements]

**Status Update Endpoints (Future - Not for Story 3.3):**

- Story 3.3 focuses on local status management and visualization only
- API submission will be handled in Story 3.4 final verification
- Local persistence ensures no data loss during status update workflow

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- Material status data should be stored securely using existing flutter_secure_storage
- No sensitive business data should be cached beyond session requirements
- Status changes should be encrypted in local storage until submission
