# Story 2.2: 从任务清单导航并强制扫描以验证物理操作

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** warehouse operator (仓库操作员),
**I want** to navigate from the task list to specific work interfaces with mandatory QR code scanning verification,
**so that** I can ensure physical operations match the digital task and prevent errors through systematic verification.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User can click on task items from the task board screen to navigate to work interfaces
2. Navigation routes to appropriate work screens based on task type:
   - "合箱校验" (Picking Verification) tasks → /picking-verification/:orderId
   - "平台收料" (Platform Receiving) tasks → /platform-receiving/:orderId
   - "产线送料" (Line Delivery) tasks → /line-delivery/:orderId
3. Before accessing the work interface, application forces QR code scanning verification screen
4. QR code scanner uses PDA camera to read order number from physical order documents
5. Manual input fallback is available if QR scanning fails or is unavailable
6. System validates scanned/input order number matches the selected task's order number
7. Only when verification succeeds can user proceed to the actual work interface
8. Clear error messages in Chinese displayed for mismatched order numbers or scan failures
9. User can cancel/go back from verification screen to return to task list
10. Verification process integrates seamlessly with existing bottom navigation system
11. Loading states provide clear feedback during order validation API calls
12. Success verification displays confirmation before proceeding to work interface

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 2.1 Dev Agent Record]

- TaskBoardBloc already handles task selection with SelectTaskEvent
- Bottom navigation system implemented with BottomNavigationWrapper
- TaskItemWidget exists with clickable navigation preparation
- TaskRepository provides task data with order numbers and task types
- go_router configured with ShellRoute for bottom navigation state preservation

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/1-项目结构与代码组织.md]

Create new order_verification feature following established patterns:

```
lib/features/order_verification/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── verification_request_model.dart    # Verification API model
│   ├── datasources/
│   │   └── verification_remote_datasource.dart # API calls
│   └── repositories/
│       └── verification_repository_impl.dart   # Repository implementation

        ├── scanner_overlay_widget.dart         # QR scanner UI overlay
        └── verification_result_widget.dart    # Verification feedback
```

Also create placeholder work interface features:

```
lib/features/picking_verification/
├── presentation/
│   └── pages/
│       └── picking_verification_screen.dart   # Placeholder screen

lib/features/platform_receiving/
├── presentation/
│   └── pages/
│       └── platform_receiving_screen.dart     # Placeholder screen

lib/features/line_delivery/
├── presentation/
│   └── pages/
│       └── line_delivery_screen.dart          # Placeholder screen
```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

- Use BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc (consistent with existing system)
- OrderVerificationBloc manages scanning, validation, and navigation states
- Integrate with TaskBoardBloc for task context
- Event-driven: UI -> Event -> BLoC -> State -> UI

### Navigation & Routing Strategy

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

- Extend existing go_router with verification and work interface routes
- Routes to add:
  - `/verification/:taskId/:orderId` - Order verification screen
  - `/picking-verification/:orderId` - Picking verification work interface
  - `/platform-receiving/:orderId` - Platform receiving work interface
  - `/line-delivery/:orderId` - Line delivery work interface
- Maintain ShellRoute wrapper for bottom navigation state preservation
- Use route parameters to pass task and order context

### Functional Requirements Integration

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR4]

**FR4 (任务导航与强制扫描)**: User clicks task item → navigate to work interface → force QR scan → verify order match → continue only if verified

**FR6 (订单识别)**: Support QR camera scanning + manual input fallback for order identification

### UX Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md]

- **Scanning-driven interaction** - QR scanning is primary interaction method
- **15-second average time** for scan-confirm flow target
- **High contrast, large fonts, large spacing** for industrial PDA use
- **Immediate feedback** for scan results and verification status
- **Prevention-first design** - mandatory verification prevents errors

### User Flow Integration

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/2-用户流程.md]

Navigation flow extension:

1. User clicks task item from "我的任务" screen
2. App navigates to verification screen with task context
3. User scans QR code or uses manual input
4. System validates scanned order matches selected task
5. On success: navigate to appropriate work interface
6. On failure: show error and allow retry/cancel

### QR Code Scanning Technical Requirements

**Package Selection**: Use mobile_scanner (modern, maintained) or qr_code_scanner
**Camera Permissions**: Add camera permission to Android manifest
**Scanner UI**: Full-screen camera with overlay guidelines and manual input button
**Error Handling**: Handle camera permission denied, scanning failures, poor lighting

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

- Extend DioClient with verification endpoints if needed
- Potential endpoint: POST /api/orders/verify - Validate order number against task
- Use existing authentication from DioClient
- Repository pattern: Screen -> Repository -> DataSource -> DioClient

### Task Type Mapping

Based on TaskType enum from Story 2.1:

```dart
enum TaskType {
  pickingVerification, // → /picking-verification/:orderId
  platformReceiving,   // → /platform-receiving/:orderId
  lineDelivery        // → /line-delivery/:orderId
}
```

### Component Standards

[Source: architecture/2-组件化标准.md]

- Prioritize StatelessWidget components
- QR scanner as full-screen modal or dedicated screen
- Reusable verification result widget for success/error feedback
- Follow standard component template for consistency

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/6-技术栈摘要.md]

- Flutter framework with camera plugin integration
- BLoC (flutter_bloc) for state management
- dio for API communication (if verification endpoint needed)
- go_router for navigation with route parameters
- Must work on Android 11 industrial PDA devices

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- No sensitive order data cached locally beyond session needs
- All API verification calls via HTTPS (existing DioClient configuration)
- Camera permission handled securely with proper user consent

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**

- `test/features/order_verification/` - Mirror the feature structure
- Follow patterns from existing `test/features/task_board/`

**Testing Standards:**

- Unit tests for verification logic and data models
- BLoC tests using blocTest package for OrderVerificationBloc
- Widget tests for QR scanner and verification screens
- Integration tests for navigation flow from task list to work interfaces
- Mock camera functionality for automated testing
- Test error scenarios: scan failures, permission denied, order mismatch

**Specific Requirements for Story 2.2:**

- Test QR scanning success and failure scenarios
- Test manual input fallback functionality
- Test order number validation logic
- Test navigation to correct work interfaces based on task type
- Test error handling with Chinese error messages
- Test bottom navigation state preservation during verification flow

### File Locations

Files to create:

- All order_verification feature files as outlined in Project Structure
- Placeholder work interface screens for picking_verification, platform_receiving, line_delivery
- Camera permission configuration in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml

Files to modify:

- `lib/core/config/app_router.dart` - Add verification and work interface routes
- `lib/features/task_board/presentation/widgets/task_item_widget.dart` - Update navigation logic
- `pubspec.yaml` - Add QR scanner dependency
- May need to extend `lib/core/api/dio_client.dart` if verification API endpoint required

### Dependencies to Add

```yaml
dependencies:
  mobile_scanner: ^5.0.0 # or qr_code_scanner: ^1.0.1
  permission_handler: ^11.0.0 # For camera permissions
```
