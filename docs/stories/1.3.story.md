# Story 1.3: 用户认证与权限管理

## Status

DONE

## Story

**As a** warehouse system administrator (系统管理员),
**I want** the application to properly manage user authentication tokens and enforce permission-based access control,
**so that** users can only access features they are authorized to use, and the system maintains security compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Authentication tokens are securely stored and automatically attached to all API requests
2. User permissions are retrieved from the authentication API response and stored in the application state
3. Permission-based routing logic directs users to appropriate screens based on their roles:
   - Single permission users go directly to their work interface
   - Multiple permission users see the main navigation screen
4. Navigation guards prevent unauthorized access to protected routes
5. Token refresh mechanism handles expired tokens automatically
6. Logout functionality clears all authentication data and redirects to login
7. Permission checks are enforced at both navigation and feature level
8. The system gracefully handles permission changes and forces re-authentication when needed
9. All permission-related errors display clear messages in Chinese
10. The authentication state persists across app restarts until explicitly logged out

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]

- Authentication infrastructure is complete with AuthBloc and AuthRepository
- Flutter Secure Storage is already integrated for token storage
- DioClient singleton exists and is configured for API communication
- Basic authentication flow is working with login/logout capabilities
- Navigation routing structure is in place with go_router
- Need to extend existing auth system rather than rebuild it

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/1-项目结构与代码组织.md]

The auth feature module already exists from Story 1.2. Extend within the same structure:

```
lib/features/auth/
├── data/
│   ├── models/           # Extend User model with permissions
│   └── repositories/     # Extend AuthRepository with permission logic
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/         # Add Permission-related entities
│   └── services/         # Add PermissionService
└── presentation/
    ├── bloc/            # Extend AuthBloc with permission state
    └── pages/           # Add HomeScreen for multi-permission users
```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

- Continue using BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc
- Extend existing AuthBloc to manage permission state
- AuthState should include user permissions for UI decisions
- Permission checks should be reactive to state changes

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

- Use existing DioClient singleton from Story 1.1
- Extend interceptor to handle token attachment and refresh
- Authentication API response includes user permissions
- Repository pattern already established - extend AuthRepository

### Navigation & Routing

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

- go_router already configured with redirect logic
- Extend redirect function to check user permissions
- Routes needed:
  - `/home` - Main navigation screen for multi-permission users
  - `/picking-verification` - Direct route for picking verification permission
  - `/platform-receiving` - Direct route for platform receiving permission
  - `/line-delivery` - Direct route for line delivery permission
- Keep existing `/login` and `/tasks` routes

### User Flow Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/2-用户流程.md]

Permission-based navigation flow:

1. After successful login → Retrieve user permissions
2. Single permission → Navigate directly to work interface
3. Multiple permissions → Show home/main navigation screen
4. Bottom navigation bar with [Home] and [My Tasks] options

### Permission Types

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR1, FR5]

Expected permission types:

- 合箱校验 (Picking Verification)
- 平台收料 (Platform Receiving)
- 产线送料 (Line Delivery)

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- All server communication via HTTPS
- Secure storage for authentication credentials
- No sensitive business data persisted locally
- Token-based authentication with secure storage

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/6-技术栈摘要.md]

- Flutter framework
- flutter_bloc for state management
- dio for network requests
- go_router for navigation
- flutter_secure_storage for token storage
