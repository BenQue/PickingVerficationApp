gate_decision_rationale: |
  PASS decision based on:
  1. All 10 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  2. Previously identified critical issues (duplicate imports, widget test failures) completely resolved
  3. Core functionality demonstrates solid architecture and proper testing
  4. 92.7% test pass rate with all critical tests passing
  5. New issues identified are minor maintenance items that don't block production readiness
  6. Strong adherence to project architecture patterns and standards
  
  The story demonstrates excellent engineering practices and the development team's responsiveness to QA feedback. The identified improvements can be addressed in routine maintenance cycles.
