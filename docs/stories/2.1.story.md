# Story 2.1: 按类型分组的任务清单 UI 与 API 集成

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** warehouse operator (仓库操作员),
**I want** to see a personal task dashboard with my assigned tasks grouped by type/stage through tabs or collapsible sections,
**so that** I can quickly identify and select the appropriate tasks from different workflow stages without confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. After login, user can access "我的任务" (My Tasks) screen through bottom navigation
2. Task list API is called to retrieve user's assigned incomplete tasks
3. Tasks are clearly grouped by type/stage using tabs or collapsible sections:
   - "合箱校验" (Picking Verification) tasks
   - "平台收料" (Platform Receiving) tasks
   - "产线送料" (Line Delivery) tasks
4. Each task item displays essential information: order number, status, and task type
5. Task list automatically refreshes to show current assignments
6. Empty states are handled gracefully with appropriate messaging
7. Loading states provide clear feedback during API calls
8. Error states display user-friendly messages in Chinese
9. Task items are clickable and prepare for navigation to work interfaces
10. Bottom navigation bar includes both "Home" and "我的任务" options with proper state management

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record]

- Authentication system is complete with AuthBloc managing user permissions
- DioClient singleton configured with automatic token attachment and refresh
- Permission-based navigation structure exists in go_router configuration
- HomeScreen exists for multi-permission users (from Story 1.3)
- Bottom navigation structure mentioned in user flow - need to implement
- flutter_secure_storage integrated for secure data management

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/1-项目结构与代码组织.md]

Create new task_board feature following established patterns:

```
lib/features/task_board/
├── data/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── task_model.dart              # Task API model
│   │   └── task_list_response_model.dart # API response model
│   ├── datasources/
│   │   └── task_remote_datasource.dart  # API calls
│   └── repositories/
│       └── task_repository_impl.dart    # Repository implementation

└── presentation/
    ├── bloc/
    │   ├── task_board_bloc.dart         # BLoC implementation
    │   ├── task_board_event.dart        # BLoC events
    │   └── task_board_state.dart        # BLoC states
    ├── pages/
    │   └── task_board_screen.dart       # Main task board screen
    └── widgets/
        ├── task_item_widget.dart        # Individual task items
        ├── task_group_section.dart      # Grouped sections
        └── bottom_navigation_wrapper.dart # Navigation wrapper
```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

- Use BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc (consistent with existing auth system)
- TaskBoardBloc will manage task list state, loading, and errors
- Integrate with existing AuthBloc to access user permissions
- Event-driven architecture: UI -> Event -> BLoC -> State -> UI

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

- Extend existing DioClient singleton with task list endpoints
- Use Repository Pattern: TaskBoardScreen -> TaskRepository -> TaskRemoteDataSource -> DioClient
- DioClient already configured with authentication interceptors from Story 1.3
- Task API endpoints needed:
  - GET /api/tasks/assigned - Get user's assigned tasks
  - Potential future: POST /api/tasks/{id}/status - Update task status

### Navigation & Routing Strategy

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

- Extend existing go_router configuration with bottom navigation
- Routes to add/modify:
  - `/home` - HomeScreen (multi-permission users, exists from Story 1.3)
  - `/tasks` - TaskBoardScreen (new task list screen)
- Bottom navigation should wrap screens and maintain state
- Navigation guards already implemented in Story 1.3

### UX Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md & 2-用户流程.md]

- **High contrast, large fonts, large spacing** for industrial use
- **Scanning-driven interaction** - prepare for future scanning integration
- **Immediate feedback** for all user operations
- **Workflow focus** - avoid distractions during task execution
- **15-second average time** for scan-confirm flow (future stories)
- **5-minute learning curve** for new users

### User Flow Integration

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/2-用户流程.md]

Bottom navigation pattern:

1. User lands on appropriate screen based on permissions (Story 1.3)
2. Bottom navigation shows [Home] [我的任务] options
3. Clicking "我的任务" -> TaskBoardScreen with grouped task list
4. Clicking "Home" -> returns to permission-appropriate home screen
5. Task items prepare for navigation to work interfaces (future stories)

### Task Grouping Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR3]

Tasks must be grouped by workflow stage:

- **合箱校验 (Picking Verification)** - Tasks requiring order verification
- **平台收料 (Platform Receiving)** - Tasks for receiving materials at platform
- **产线送料 (Line Delivery)** - Tasks for delivering materials to production line

Each group should be implemented as tabs or collapsible sections for clear separation.

### API Data Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR2, FR11]

Task API response should include:

- Task ID
- Order number
- Task type/stage (verification, receiving, delivery)
- Current status
- Assignment information
- Any relevant metadata for display

### Component Standards

[Source: architecture/2-组件化标准.md]

- Prioritize StatelessWidget components
- Break complex UI into single-responsibility components
- Follow standard component template for consistency
- Create reusable widgets for task items and groups

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/6-技术栈摘要.md]

- Flutter framework
- BLoC (flutter_bloc) for state management
- dio for API communication
- go_router for navigation
- flutter_secure_storage for any secure data (already integrated)

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**

- `test/features/task_board/` - Mirror the feature structure
- Follow patterns from `test/features/auth/` (Story 1.3)

**Testing Standards:**

- Unit tests for repositories and data models
- BLoC tests using blocTest package
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for API communication
- Maintain existing 95% coverage standard

**Specific Requirements for Story 2.1:**

- Test task grouping logic and display
- Test API error handling with Chinese messages
- Test bottom navigation state management
- Test empty states for each task type
- Test refresh functionality

### File Locations

Files to create:

- All task_board feature files as outlined in Project Structure
- `lib/core/widgets/bottom_navigation_wrapper.dart` - Reusable navigation

Files to modify:

- `lib/core/config/app_router.dart` - Add task board route and bottom navigation
- May need to extend `lib/core/api/dio_client.dart` if new endpoints required

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- All API communication via HTTPS (already configured in DioClient)
- Use existing secure token storage from Story 1.3
- No sensitive business data persisted locally beyond session needs
- Task data should be refreshed rather than cached long-term
