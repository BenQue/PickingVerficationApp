# Story 1.2: 登录界面 UI

## Status

DONE

## Story

**As a** warehouse operator (拣配、收料、送料岗),
**I want** a secure and intuitive login interface that I can easily use while wearing gloves on an industrial PDA,
**so that** I can quickly authenticate myself and access my assigned tasks without struggling with small UI elements or complex interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Login screen displays company logo and clear "登录" (Login) title
2. Two input fields are provided: Employee ID (员工 ID) and Password (密码) with large, glove-friendly touch targets
3. Login form follows industrial PDA design principles: high contrast, large fonts (≥16px), large buttons (≥56px height)
4. Input validation provides clear error messages in Chinese for empty fields or invalid credentials
5. "登录" (Login) button is prominent, accessible, and calls authentication API
6. Loading state is shown during authentication with appropriate feedback
7. On successful authentication, user is redirected based on their permissions (single permission → direct to work interface, multiple permissions → main navigation screen)
8. Failed authentication shows clear error message and allows retry
9. All network errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
10. Login credentials are securely stored using Flutter Secure Storage
11. Login screen is responsive and works in portrait orientation on Android 11 PDAs

    ├── pages/                    # LoginScreen
    └── widgets/                  # Login-specific widgets
```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

- Use BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc library for authentication state management
- Core flow: LoginScreen dispatches LoginRequested event → AuthBloc processes authentication → AuthBloc emits new state → UI rebuilds based on state
- States needed: AuthInitial, AuthLoading, AuthSuccess, AuthFailure

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

- Use existing DioClient singleton configured in Story 1.1
- Create AuthRepository class following Repository Pattern to isolate API complexity from BLoC
- Authentication API will return JWT token for secure storage
- Implement automatic token attachment via DioClient interceptor

### Navigation & Routing

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

- Use existing AppRouter configuration from Story 1.1
- Login route: /login (already configured as placeholder)
- Implement redirect logic for permission-based navigation:
  - Single permission users → direct to their work interface
  - Multiple permission users → main navigation screen (/tasks)
- Update router guards to check authentication token from secure storage

### UI/UX Design Specifications

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md]

- Target users: 仓库操作员 wearing gloves on industrial PDAs
- Usability goals: 5-minute learning curve for new employees
- Design principles: 清晰第一 (clarity first), 工业级耐用性 (industrial durability)
- High contrast, large fonts (≥16px), large spacing, 56px minimum button height

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/2-用户流程.md]

- Flow: App launch → Check login status → If not logged in show login screen
- After successful login: Check user permissions → Route to appropriate screen
- Login screen inputs: Employee ID, Password → Call authentication API

### Component Standards

[Source: architecture/2-组件化标准.md]

- Prefer StatelessWidget over StatefulWidget where possible
- Use existing common widgets from lib/core/widgets/common_widgets.dart:
  - AppTextFormField for input fields
  - PrimaryButton for main login button
  - LoadingWidget for loading states
  - ErrorWidget for error display

### Technical Constraints

[Source: Story 1.1 completion notes & architecture/6-技术栈摘要.md]

- Flutter framework with Material 3 design system
- Must work smoothly on Android 11 industrial PDAs
- Network requests via dio HTTP client
- Secure token storage via flutter_secure_storage
- State management via flutter_bloc
- Navigation via go_router

- lib/features/auth/presentation/bloc/ → AuthBloc, AuthEvent, AuthState
- lib/features/auth/presentation/pages/ → LoginScreen widget
- test/features/auth/ → Corresponding test files mirroring lib structure
