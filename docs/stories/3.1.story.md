# Story 3.1: 激活并进入合箱校验模式

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** warehouse operator (仓库操作员),
**I want** to activate and enter picking verification mode from verified order navigation,
**so that** I can begin the comprehensive picking verification workflow to replace manual verification processes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. User accesses picking verification mode through verified order navigation from task board (builds on Story 2.2 verification flow)
2. Application activates complete picking verification interface replacing the current placeholder screen
3. Order verification context is maintained from the navigation flow (order number passed through)
4. Interface displays order-specific information and confirmation that verification has been properly initiated
5. Screen provides clear indication that user is now in active "合箱校验模式" (Picking Verification Mode)
6. Interface includes preparation for next story workflow (order scanning/input for details retrieval)
7. User can navigate back to task list while maintaining proper navigation state
8. All UI elements follow industrial PDA design standards (large fonts, high contrast, Chinese localization)
9. Loading states provide feedback during order data retrieval and mode activation
10. Error handling provides clear Chinese error messages if activation fails
11. Interface integrates seamlessly with existing bottom navigation system
12. Mode activation is confirmed through visual indicators and proper screen title

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: Story 2.2 Dev Agent Record]

- OrderVerificationBloc established for verification flow with order context management
- Order verification navigation implemented: TaskBoard → Verification → Work Interface
- PickingVerificationScreen placeholder exists at `lib/features/picking_verification/presentation/pages/picking_verification_screen.dart`
- Route `/picking-verification/:orderId` configured in app router
- Bottom navigation integration established with BottomNavigationWrapper
- Order context properly passed through route parameters

### Project Structure

[Source: architecture/1-项目结构与代码组织.md]

Picking verification feature structure already initiated in Story 2.2:

```
lib/features/picking_verification/

└── presentation/
    ├── bloc/
    │   ├── picking_verification_bloc.dart  # BLoC implementation
    │   ├── picking_verification_event.dart # BLoC events
    │   └── picking_verification_state.dart # BLoC states
    ├── pages/

    └── widgets/
        ├── order_info_card_widget.dart     # Order information display
        ├── mode_activation_widget.dart     # Mode activation confirmation
        └── verification_status_widget.dart # Status indicators
```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

- Use BLoC pattern with flutter_bloc (consistent with existing system)
- PickingVerificationBloc manages mode activation, order context, and preparation states
- Integrate with existing OrderVerificationBloc for order context continuity
- Event-driven: Navigation → Activation Event → BLoC → State → UI

### Navigation & Routing Strategy

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

- Route `/picking-verification/:orderId` already configured from Story 2.2
- Maintain ShellRoute wrapper for bottom navigation state preservation
- Order context passed through route parameters from verification flow
- Back navigation returns to task list (/tasks) with proper state

### Functional Requirements Integration

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR5]

**FR5 (多模式导航)**: For users with multiple permissions, provide clear interface for selecting work modes. For single permission users, direct entry to available interface.

This story activates the picking verification mode specifically, building the foundation for the complete picking verification workflow (Stories 3.2-3.4).

### UX Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md]

- **Clear First**: Mode activation must be extremely clear and unambiguous
- **Scanning-driven interaction**: Prepare interface for scanning workflows in next stories
- **Immediate feedback**: Mode activation provides instant confirmation
- **Workflow focus**: Interface avoids distractions, focuses on verification tasks
- **Industrial durability**: High contrast, large fonts, large spacing for PDA use

### User Flow Integration

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/2-用户流程.md]

Navigation flow from Story 2.2:

1. User clicks picking verification task from task board
2. Order verification screen validates order match (Story 2.2)
3. On successful verification → Navigate to picking verification mode (Story 3.1)
4. **Mode activation confirmed** with clear visual indicators
5. Interface prepares for order details workflow (Story 3.2)

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

- Extend DioClient with picking verification endpoints
- Repository pattern: Screen → Repository → DataSource → DioClient
- Potential endpoint: GET /api/orders/:orderId/picking - Retrieve order for picking verification
- Use existing authentication from DioClient configuration

### Component Standards

[Source: architecture/2-组件化标准.md]

- Prioritize StatelessWidget components for order display and mode indicators
- Create reusable widgets for order info card and mode activation confirmation
- Follow standard component template for consistency
- Break complex verification UI into single-responsibility components

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/6-技术栈摘要.md]

- Flutter framework with existing project patterns
- BLoC (flutter_bloc) for state management
- dio for API communication (extend existing DioClient)
- go_router for navigation with route parameters
- Must work on Android 11 industrial PDA devices

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- All API communication via HTTPS (existing DioClient configuration)
- Order data should not be cached locally beyond session needs
- Use existing authentication token management

### Testing

**Test File Locations:**

- `test/features/picking_verification/` - Mirror the feature structure
- Follow patterns from existing `test/features/order_verification/` and `test/features/task_board/`

**Testing Standards:**

- Unit tests for picking verification logic and data models
- BLoC tests using blocTest package for PickingVerificationBloc
- Widget tests for mode activation UI and order display components
- Integration tests for navigation flow from Story 2.2 verification
- Mock API responses for order data retrieval
- Test error scenarios: API failures, invalid order data, navigation issues

**Specific Requirements for Story 3.1:**

- Test mode activation flow from order verification navigation
- Test order context preservation through navigation
- Test back navigation to task list
- Test UI components with industrial PDA design standards
- Test Chinese localization and error messages
- Test integration with existing bottom navigation system

### File Locations

Files to create:

- All picking_verification feature files as outlined in Project Structure
- Replace existing placeholder screen with functional implementation

Files to modify:

- Current placeholder: `lib/features/picking_verification/presentation/pages/picking_verification_screen.dart` - Replace with functional implementation
- May need to extend `lib/core/api/dio_client.dart` if new picking verification endpoints required

### Dependencies

Existing dependencies from previous stories should be sufficient:

- flutter_bloc for state management
- dio for API communication
- go_router for navigation
- flutter_secure_storage for authentication (already integrated)
