## Issues Found and Fixed

### Issue 1: API Parameter Mismatches
**Problem**: Integration tests were using outdated API
- `AddCableBarcode` event called with non-existent `factoryId` parameter
- `ShelvingInProgress` state missing required `canSubmit` parameter
- `CableItem.fromLineStock()` called with non-existent `canSubmit` parameter

**Fix**: Complete rewrite of test files after reading actual source code
- Removed `factoryId` from all `AddCableBarcode` calls
- Added `canSubmit` parameter to all `ShelvingInProgress` states
- Fixed `CableItem.fromLineStock()` calls to use correct factory signature

**Files Fixed**:
- `test/features/line_stock/integration/cable_shelving_flow_test.dart`
- `test/features/line_stock/integration/error_recovery_test.dart`
- `test/features/line_stock/integration/edge_cases_test.dart`

### Issue 2: Non-existent Exception Type
**Problem**: Tests referenced `UnauthorizedException` which doesn't exist in codebase

**Fix**: Replaced with `ServerException` after reading `lib/core/error/exceptions.dart`

**Impact**: Error recovery tests now use correct exception types matching actual implementation

### Issue 3: Invalid Matcher Syntax
**Problem**: Using pipe operator `|` between matchers instead of `anyOf()`
```dart
expect(state.message, contains('已存在') | contains('重复')); // Wrong
```

**Fix**: Changed to use proper `anyOf()` function
```dart
expect(state.message, anyOf(contains('已存在'), contains('重复'))); // Correct
```

### Issue 4: State Expectation Mismatches
**Problem**: `blocTest` skip parameters were incorrect, causing state sequence mismatches
- Tests expected certain states but got different states due to wrong skip count
- Example: Expected `LineStockLoading` at position [0] but got `ShelvingInProgress`

**Fix**: Adjusted skip parameters based on actual state emissions:
- Adding first cable: `skip: 1` (skip SetTargetLocation state)
- Confirming shelving after adding cables: `skip: 5` (skip SetLocation + 2x(Loading+Shelving))
- Transfer errors after setup: `skip: 3` (skip SetLocation + Loading + ShelvingInProgress)

**Root Cause**: Each cable addition emits Loading + ShelvingInProgress pair, which accumulates in multi-cable scenarios

### Issue 5: Wrong Loading Message
**Problem**: Tests expected `'查询电缆信息...'` but actual implementation uses `'验证条码...'`

**Fix**: Changed expected message to match actual BLoC implementation after reading source code

**Learning**: Always verify expected messages against actual implementation, not assumptions

## Static Analysis Results

### Analysis Command
```bash
flutter analyze lib/features/line_stock/
```

### Results
- **Total Issues**: 9 warnings
- **Error Level**: 0 errors
- **Warning Type**: All deprecation warnings
- **Status**: ✅ Acceptable per Stage 6 guidelines

### Deprecation Warnings Breakdown
All 9 warnings are in `shelving_summary.dart` related to:
```dart
'MaterialStateProperty' is deprecated and shouldn't be used.
Use WidgetStateProperty instead.
```

**Assessment**: These are Flutter framework deprecation warnings that can be addressed in future maintenance. They do not affect functionality or test reliability.

**Action**: No immediate fix required. Can be addressed in a future code modernization task.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
✅ None required - Stage 6 is complete

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. **Deprecation Warnings**: Update `shelving_summary.dart` to use `WidgetStateProperty` instead of deprecated `MaterialStateProperty` (9 occurrences)

2. **Widget Test Failures**: Investigate and fix 2 pre-existing widget test failures (not related to Stage 6 work)

3. **Performance Testing**: Consider manual testing of:
   - Scrolling performance with 50+ cables in list
   - Memory usage during extended shelving sessions
   - API response time validation in real environment

4. **Documentation**: Create end-user documentation:
   - `USER_MANUAL.md` - User operation guide
   - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions
   - Capture screenshots of key functionality

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Test API Accuracy**: Always verify test code against actual implementation, not assumptions
2. **State Sequence Understanding**: BLoC state emissions can accumulate in complex workflows - use `skip` carefully
3. **Mock Consistency**: Keep mock data realistic and consistent with actual API responses
4. **Error Testing Importance**: Error recovery tests found several edge cases that improved robustness

### Process Improvements
1. **Read Implementation First**: Before writing integration tests, thoroughly read the actual BLoC, event, and state implementations
2. **Run Tests Frequently**: Frequent test runs help catch issues early when they're easier to fix
3. **Complete Rewrites vs Patches**: For severely outdated tests, complete rewrites are faster than incremental patches
4. **Static Analysis Early**: Run static analysis during development, not just at the end
