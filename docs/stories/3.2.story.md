```

### State Management Strategy

[Source: architecture/3-状态管理策略.md]

**BLoC Pattern Extension:**

- Extend existing PickingVerificationBloc with new states: Scanning, OrderLookup, OrderDetailsLoaded, OrderNotFound
- Add new events: StartScanning, ScanOrderCode, EnterOrderManually, LoadOrderDetails
- Maintain existing event-driven flow: UI Event → BLoC Processing → State Update → UI Rebuild
- Order details state should persist for use in Stories 3.3-3.4

**Integration with Story 3.1:**

- Build upon existing mode activation flow
- Extend order context management for comprehensive order details
- Maintain existing navigation and bottom navigation integration

### API Integration Strategy

[Source: architecture/4-api-集成策略.md]

**Repository Pattern Extension:**

- Extend existing PickingRepository interface with order lookup methods
- Add new API endpoint integration: GET /api/orders/:orderId/details
- Utilize existing DioClient with authentication and error handling
- Expected API response structure for comprehensive order data with material categorization

**Data Flow:**
Screen → PickingRepository → PickingRemoteDataSource → DioClient → Backend API

### Functional Requirements Integration

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md]

**FR6 (订单识别)**: In all work modes, must support QR code scanning via PDA camera and provide backup manual input interface.

**FR7 (物料清单与状态可视化)**: In picking verification mode, must display material lists grouped by "断线物料", "中央仓物料", "自动化库物料" with clear color+icon combinations for status indication.

**FR11 (API 数据提交)**: Program must call appropriate backend APIs with correct parameters for order lookup and validation.

**FR12 (清晰的反馈与异常处理)**: All operations must provide clear, understandable feedback messages to users for success, failure, and network errors.

### UX Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md]

**Core Design Principles for Story 3.2:**

- **扫描驱动**: QR scanning is the primary, core interaction method - scanning interface must be prominent and accessible
- **清晰第一**: Order information, material categories, and scanning states must be extremely clear and unambiguous
- **即时反馈**: Every scan attempt, manual input, and API call must provide immediate, perceivable system response
- **工业级耐用性**: High contrast, large fonts, large spacing optimized for PDA use with potential glove operation

**Performance Targets:**

- **易学性**: New operators complete scanning workflow in < 5 minutes
- **高效性**: Complete scan-to-details-display cycle in < 15 seconds average

### Navigation & Routing Strategy

[Source: architecture/5-导航与路由.md]

**Existing Route Structure from Story 3.1:**

- Route: `/picking-verification/:orderId` already configured with PickingVerificationScreen
- Maintains ShellRoute wrapper for bottom navigation state
- Order context from task board navigation maintained

**Story 3.2 Navigation Flow:**

1. User in picking verification mode (Story 3.1 activation complete)
2. User activates scanning interface or manual input
3. After successful order lookup → Display comprehensive order details on same screen
4. Prepare for material status interaction workflow (Story 3.3)
5. Back navigation returns to picking verification home or task list with proper state

### Material Categorization Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR7]

**Three Material Categories:**

1. **"断线物料" (Line Break Materials)**: Materials from production line interruptions
2. **"中央仓物料" (Central Warehouse Materials)**: Materials from central warehouse inventory
3. **"自动化库物料" (Automated Warehouse Materials)**: Materials from automated storage systems

**Material Information Display:**

- Material name and description
- Required quantity vs available quantity
- Current status indicator (preparation for Story 3.3 status management)
- Storage location information

### Camera Integration Requirements

[Source: architecture/ui-ux/1-整体-ux-目标与原则.md + NFR requirements]

**QR Code Scanning Specifications:**

- Primary interaction method - scanning interface must be prominent
- Must work on Android 11 industrial PDA devices
- Camera permissions handling with clear user feedback
- QR code detection with automatic order number extraction
- Fallback to manual input when camera not available or scanning fails
- High contrast scanning overlay optimized for industrial environments

### Error Handling Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - FR12 + NFR3]

**Comprehensive Error Scenarios:**

- Invalid order numbers (scanned or manually entered)
- Network connectivity issues during API calls
- Camera permission denied or camera not available
- QR code scanning failures or unreadable codes
- Backend API errors (order not found, unauthorized access)
- Order not eligible for picking verification (wrong status)

**Error Message Standards:**

- All error messages in Chinese
- Clear, actionable guidance for users
- No technical jargon - warehouse operator friendly language
- Immediate feedback with visual indicators

### Security Requirements

[Source: docs/prd/2-需求-requirements.md - NFR4]

- All API communication via HTTPS through existing DioClient
- Camera permissions properly requested and handled
- Order data should not be cached locally beyond session requirements
- Use existing authentication token management from Story 3.1 foundation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-05

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation shows significant gaps between the documented completion and actual code state. While foundation components were created (entities, models, widgets), critical integration pieces are missing that prevent the feature from functioning as specified.

**Critical Issues Found:**

1. **BLoC Integration Missing**: The PickingVerificationBloc has NO event handlers for StartScanning, ScanOrderCode, EnterOrderManually, SwitchToManualInput, or LoadOrderDetails events despite these being defined
2. **Screen Integration Absent**: PickingVerificationScreen doesn't import or use OrderScanningWidget or ManualInputWidget - the core scanning functionality is completely disconnected
3. **Test Coverage Gaps**: Missing widget tests for scanning, manual input, and material display widgets despite claims of comprehensive testing
4. **Integration Tests Missing**: No integration tests for camera permissions or scanning workflow exist

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as the implementation is incomplete and would require substantial additions rather than improvements to existing code.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✗] BLoC pattern violated - events defined but not handled
- Project Structure: [✓] Files organized correctly following clean architecture
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Missing critical test coverage claimed in story
- All ACs Met: [✗] Core functionality not integrated

### Improvements Checklist

**Must Fix Before Story Completion:**

- [ ] Add event handlers in PickingVerificationBloc for all scanning events
- [ ] Integrate OrderScanningWidget and ManualInputWidget into PickingVerificationScreen
- [ ] Implement state management flow for scanning → lookup → display cycle
- [ ] Create widget tests for all new UI components (4 widgets missing tests)
- [ ] Add integration tests for camera permissions and scanning workflow
- [ ] Wire up navigation between scanning and manual input modes
- [ ] Connect scanning results to order lookup API calls

**Architecture Concerns:**

- [ ] Consider extracting scanning logic to separate BLoC for better separation
- [ ] Add proper error recovery for camera permission denial
- [ ] Implement proper disposal of camera controller resources

### Security Review

- Camera permissions handling code exists but not integrated into permission flow
- No validation of scanned QR code format before API submission
- Manual input validation is basic (length check only)

### Performance Considerations

- Camera controller lifecycle management needs proper disposal to prevent memory leaks
- No debouncing on manual input submission could lead to duplicate API calls

### Files Modified During Review

None - implementation too incomplete for refactoring

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/3.2-扫描或手动输入订单以获取详情.yml
